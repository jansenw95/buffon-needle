# Buffon's Needle manim code

This project contains the code used to generate the explanatory [Buffon's Needle video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUKD3BUApVY) inspired by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

This entirely consists of scenes generated using the library [ManimCommunity](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/), the community maintained version of 3Blue1Brown's [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) which is used in his own videos.
